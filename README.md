# Printf Project - ALX
This is the first academic project in alx software engineering program. 

this project is an implementation from scratch to the "printf" standard library function that is included in <stdio.h> standard library. 
This function's main goal is to print formatted output to the stream.

There are many specifiers for this function, like: c, s, d, i, x, f, lu, llu, g, e ... etc. We will be implementing some of them later.
